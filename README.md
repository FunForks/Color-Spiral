# Color Spiral #

This proof-of-concept project displays a spiral of colours which fit together in a _Golden Ratio_ sequence.

[Check out the demo](https://funforks.github.io/Color-Spiral/)

Suppose you want each player in a game to have an avatar with a different colour, but you don't know how many players there will be. Using hues that are separated from each other by (the Golden Angle)[https://medium.com/@winwardo/simple-non-repeating-colour-generation-6efc995832b8] means that a series of consecutive colours are optimally far apart.

The numbers indicate the order in which the colours were generated

If you click on a colour chip, you will toggle the way it is displayed. This is just a simulation. In a real project, this might indicate that the colour has already been selected by another player.

## Enjoy!
